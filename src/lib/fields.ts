/**
 * Generic field-projection mask for `--fields` on the reader commands.
 *
 * `--fields` post-filters a command's `--json` output down to a caller-supplied
 * set of keys, so an agent can pull exactly the leaves it needs and spend fewer
 * tokens. It composes with the slim/full choice: it projects whatever shape the
 * reader already produced (the slim shape by default, the full payload with
 * `--full`), reusing that documented vocabulary rather than inventing its own.
 *
 * Syntax: a comma-separated list, with dot-notation for nested keys
 * (`source.slug`, `org.name`). Dot-notation walks plain objects only — it does
 * not index into arrays, so request an array-valued field whole (`media`) and
 * read its elements client-side.
 *
 * A requested field that isn't present is simply absent from the output (no
 * throw); callers surface a single stderr warning for fields that matched
 * nothing, so a typo is visible without corrupting the JSON on stdout.
 */
