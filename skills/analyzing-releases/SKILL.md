  Analyze release trends across multiple companies to produce competitive

  identify industry trends, forecast upcoming releases, or answer questions
  like "what is X shipping lately" or "how does X compare to Y." Also triggers
  on requests for competitive landscape analysis, feature gap analysis, or
  release velocity comparisons.

# Analyzing Releases

Turn changelog data into competitive intelligence by analyzing release patterns across a cohort of related companies.

This is a **reader** workflow — it uses only the public, unauthenticated tools. There is no AI summarize/compare tool on the hosted MCP and no `summary`/`compare` command in the CLI; you fetch the raw release data and synthesize the analysis yourself.

## Tools for each step

| Operation | CLI (reader) | MCP tool |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Find what's indexed for a company | `releases search <company> --json` | `search` (with `type: ["orgs","catalog"]`) |
| List a company's sources | `releases list --query <company> --json` | `list_catalog` (scope with `organization`) |
| Latest releases (source or org) | `releases tail <slug> --json` · `releases tail --org <org> --json` | `get_latest_releases` (`organization` / `product`, `since`/`until`) |
| Keyword/semantic release search | `releases search <query> --json` | `search` with `type: ["releases"]` |
| Read one release in full | `releases get <rel_id> --json` | `get_release` |
| Read a tracked CHANGELOG slice | `releases admin source changelog <slug> --tokens <n>` (key-gated; readers use MCP) | `get_catalog_entry` with `changelog_tokens` / `changelog_offset` (keyless) |

All releases are indexed already — you don't need to (and as a reader can't) trigger fetches. If a company isn't in the registry at all, say so rather than trying to onboard it; onboarding is an operator task.

## Workflow

### 1. Define the cohort

Pick 3-6 companies in the same competitive space. Good cohorts share a common buyer or technical layer (e.g., developer databases, frontend frameworks, observability tools).

### 2. See what's indexed

Resolve each company with `search` (or `releases search`). For discovery-style cohorts ("find observability vendors with edge offerings"), `search` with `type: ["orgs","catalog"]` is vector-backed and matches on description and category — better than a slug-substring `list_catalog --query`. If a company isn't found, note it as a gap rather than fabricating data.

### 3. Pull latest releases with dates

Get structured release data per source or per org. Scope by `organization` for a whole-company view, or by a single source/product for a narrower one. Use a `since` window (e.g. `"6m"`) or a count limit to bound the set. Dates are what you'll count for velocity, so keep them.

### 4. Search and cross-reference

Search across all indexed releases to find a specific feature, breaking change, or pattern. Release search is hybrid (lexical + semantic) by default, so natural-language queries like "auth refresh tokens" or "cold start improvements" work without exact keyword matches. Pass `mode: "lexical"` (CLI `--mode lexical`) when you need strict keyword behavior.

**Result shape:** every hit carries a `kind` discriminator:

- `kind: "release"` — a normal release row; use it directly.
- `kind: "changelog_chunk"` — a passage from a stored CHANGELOG.md. The hit includes the source id and the chunk's `offset` and `length`. To read the surrounding section before quoting, call `get_catalog_entry` with that source id and `changelog_offset` set to the chunk offset (add `changelog_tokens`, e.g. 2000, for a heading-aligned slice). Chunk hits often surface older or more granular notes than the indexed release rows, so they're useful for "when did X first ship" questions.

### 5. Synthesize

Combine the raw data into a structured analysis:

- **Release velocity table** — releases per company over the window, cadence pattern
- **Trends adopted across the board** — features 3+ companies shipped in the same window
- **Differentiating bets** — what each company is investing in that others aren't
- **Gaps** — what competitors shipped that a given company hasn't
- **Forecasts** — predictions grounded in pre-release tracks, deprecations, and trajectory

## Output

Ask the user where to save the analysis, or use your best judgment based on the project's conventions. Include a short "Process Notes" section listing the exact commands/tools used, so the analysis is reproducible.

## Important

- Focus on what companies shipped. If a source has noisy data (blog posts mixed in, missing dates), work around it silently — don't pad the report with source-quality commentary unless a company had to be substantially excluded.
- Fill data gaps with web fetches: list a source to get release URLs, then WebFetch to spot-check pages for a missing date, version, or detail.
- For velocity counting, lean on the dated rows from `get_latest_releases` / `releases tail --json`.
- Comparison and summarization are yours to synthesize from raw release data — there is no built-in tool that does it for you.
